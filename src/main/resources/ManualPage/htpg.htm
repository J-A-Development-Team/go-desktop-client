<h2>The Board</h2>Go is usually played on a 19x19 grid, or board. Diagram 1 shows an empty board.<br>
Notice the nine marked points. These points are usually referred to as the star points.
 They serve as reference points as well as markers on which the handicap stones are placed in handicap games.<br>
<table><tbody><tr><td><img src="HOW%20TO%20PLAY%20GO_files/go1.gif" width="380" height="410"></td>
<td><font size="+1"><h2>The Stones</h2>
The pieces used are black and white lens-shaped disks, called stones.
<p>Black starts out with 181 stones and White with 180. The total of 361
 stones corresponds to the number of intersections on the standard 19x19
 go board.
<br>The stones are usually kept in wooden bowls next to the board.<br>
</p><h2>How Go Is Played</h2>
At the beginning of the game, the board is empty.
<p>One player takes the black stones, the other player the white ones.
</p><p>The player with the black stones, referred to as `Black', makes the first move. 
The player with the white stones, referred to as `White', makes the second move. Thereafter, they alternate making their moves.
</p><p></p></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
A move is made by placing a stone on an interesection.
<p>A player can play on any unoccupied intersection he wants to.
</p><p>A stone does not move after being played, unless it is captured and taken off the board.
<br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="HOW%20TO%20PLAY%20GO_files/go2.gif" width="380" height="410"></td><td><font size="+1">Diagram 2 shows the beginning of a game. 
<p>Black plays the first move in the upper right corner.
</p><p>White plays 2 in the lower right corner.</p><p>Black plays 3 and White plays 4.
</p><p>This is a typical opening where each player has staked out a position in the two of the four corners.
</p><p>Next Black approaches White 2 with 5 and White pincers 5 with 6.
</p><p>Black escapes into the center with 7 and White stakes out a position in the bottom right with 8. 
</p><p>Next Black pincers the white stone at 6 with 9.<br>
</p></font></td></tr></tbody></table></p><h2>The Object of Go Is to Control Territory</h2>
The object of go is to control more territory than your opponent. At the
 end of the game, the player who controls the more territory wins the 
game.<p>We are going to show you how territory is formed in a game on a 
9x9 board. Although go is usually played on a 19x19 board, it can also 
be played on a 9x9 board, or any size board from 5x5 up. Explaining the 
rules on a 9x9 board is convenient because the game is over quickly and 
the beginner can immediately grasp the flow of the game and how the 
score is counted. We also recommend that you play your first games on a 
9x9 board and, when you have mastered the rules, start playing on the 
19x19 board.
<br></p><h2>An Example Game</h2>Figure 1, Black makes his first move on the 4-4 point, after which White makes his move.<table><tbody><tr><td><img src="HOW%20TO%20PLAY%20GO_files/go3.gif" width="200" height="218"></td><td><font size="+1">
 Thereafter, both sides continue to alternate in making their moves. 
With White 6, the territories of both sides are beginning to take shape.<p> Black has stake out the right side and White has laid claim to the left side.</p><p>Once you have mapped out your territory, there are two basic strategies to choose from.</p><p>
 One is to expand your own territory while reducing your opponent's 
territory. The other is to invade the territory your opponent has mapped
 out.</p></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="HOW%20TO%20PLAY%20GO_files/go4.gif" width="200" height="218"></td><td><font size="+1">Black 7 in Figure 2 follows the first strategy: <p>Black expands his territory on the lower right while</p><p> preventing White from expanding his own with a move at White `a'. </p><p>White must defend at 8 to block an incursion by Black into his territory on the left.</p><p> Next, Black reinforces his territory on the right with 9.
</p></font></td></tr></tbody></table><p><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="HOW%20TO%20PLAY%20GO_files/go5.gif" width="180" height="218"></td><td>
<font size="+1">It is now White's turn to expand his territory. 
<p>He does this by first expanding his center 
</p><p>with 10 and 12 in Figure 3, then expanding his upper </p><p>left territory with 14.
</p><p> Black must defend his top right territory with 15.
</p><p>The points around `a' at the top and bottom must now be decided.</p><p></p></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

The moves from White 16 to Black 19 in Figure 4 are a common sequence. 
<p>The same kind of sequence is next played at the bottom
</p><p> from White 20 to Black 23.</p><p>By playing these moves, White is able to expand his territory
</p><p> while reducing Black's.</p><p></p></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

<td><font size="+1">White 24 to White 26 in Figure 5 are the last moves of the game.
<p> It is now possible to determine the winner.
</p><p> In this case, counting the score is easy.

Therefore, Black wins by one point.</p><p></p></font></td></tr></tbody></table>This was a very simple game and some of the rules did not arise. However, playing over this game will show you what Go is about.<br></p><h1>The Rule of Capture</h1>An
 important rule of Go concerns the capturing of stones. We will first 
show you how stones are captured, then show how this occurs in a game.<br><h2>Liberties</h2><p><img src="HOW%20TO%20PLAY%20GO_files/go9.gif" width="600" height="220"><br><br>The lone white stone in Diagram 3 has four liberties.<br>Namely, the four points `a' in Diagram 4. If Black can occupy all four of these points, he captures the white stone.<br>Suppose, for example, that Black occupies three of these liberties in Diagram 5. The white stone would be in <i>atari</i> and Black would be able to capture it on his next move, that is with 1 in Diagram 6.<br>Black
 would then remove the white stone from the board and put it in his 
prisoner pile. The result of this capture is shown in Diagram 7.</p><p><img src="HOW%20TO%20PLAY%20GO_files/go10.gif" width="600" height="220"></p><p>At
 the edge of the board a stone has only three liberties. The white stone
 in Diagram 8 is on the edge of the board; that is on the first line.<br>Its three liberties are at `a' in Diagram 9.<br>If Black occupies two of these liberties, as in Diagram 10, the white stone would be in <i>atari</i>.<br>Black captures this stone with 1 in Diagram 11.<br>The result of this capture is shown in Diagram 12.</p><p><img src="HOW%20TO%20PLAY%20GO_files/go11.gif" width="600" height="220"></p><p>A stone in the corner has only two liberties. The white stone in Diagram 13 is on the 1-1 point.<br>Its two liberties are at `a' in Diagram 14.<br>If Black occupies one of these points, as in Diagram 15, the white stone would be in <i>atari</i>.<br>Black captures this stone with 1 in Diagram 16.<br>The result is shown in Diagram 17.</p><p><img src="HOW%20TO%20PLAY%20GO_files/go12.gif" width="600" height="410"><br><br>It
 is also possible to capture two or more stones if you occupy all their 
liberties. In Diagram 18, there are three positions in which two white 
stones are in <i>atari</i>.<br>Black captures these stones with 1 in Diagram 19.<br>The results are shown in Diagram 20.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="HOW%20TO%20PLAY%20GO_files/go13.gif" width="380" height="410"></td><td><font size="+1">Any number of stones making up any kind of shape can be captured if all their liberties are occupied.<p><br> In Diagram 21, there are four different positions.</p><p><br>Black
 1 captures twelve stones in the upper left, four stones in the lower 
left, three stones in the upper right and three stones in the lower 
right.<br></p><p>When you capture stones in a game, you put them in your prisoner pile. </p><p>Then, at the end of the game, these captured stones are placed inside your opponent's territory.</p><p><br> Let's look at a game to see how this actually works.</p><p></p></font></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="HOW%20TO%20PLAY%20GO_files/go14.gif" width="180" height="218"></td><td><font size="+1">After

 Black 15 in Figure 9, it might seem as if the two White stones in atari
 could escape by extending to `a'.
